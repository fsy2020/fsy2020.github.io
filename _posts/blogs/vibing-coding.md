# Vibe Coding

## Reflections on Vibe Coding

Though vibe coding can boost productivity, there are several important aspects worth discussing:

- Redundant Code Generation:  
  When building a project and encountering issues, continuing to rely on the model to generate code often leads to redundant or excessive output. The model may introduce irrelevant logic that doesn't directly address the specific requirement, resulting in a bloated codebase.

- Debugging Challenges:  
  I have some debugging skills and can utilize the console to inspect and troubleshoot. However, pinpointing and resolving a bug usually takes multiple attempts. During this process, I might accidentally modify unrelated parts of the code, which can create confusion or introduce new problems.

These challenges highlight the importance of combining AI-assisted coding with critical thinking and manual review to maintain code quality and clarity.
