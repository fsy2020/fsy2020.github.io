# Super Mario Maker 2 Versus Rating Application  

I was a dedicated Versus player back in college, and Iâ€™ve been trying to build this app for several years. However, due to my limited coding skills and lack of experience in scripting, I wasnâ€™t able to make much progress. When vibe coding became more popular, I realized it had become much easier to create a prototype with minimal high-level code.  

At the beginning of this project, I used a Raspberry Pi and crontab to collect data from the [Super Mario Maker 2 API](https://tgrcode.com/mm2/docs/) created by tgrcode. I continued collecting data for almost a year until I discovered a [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TheGreatRambler/mm2_user) that had already been compiled by tgr. This inspired me to visualize the data to make it easier for users to access and explore.  

So I decided to build a modern web application to display Super Mario Maker 2 player statistics, rankings, and trend analysis.  

Here is the websiteâ€”feel free to try it out :)
